In this exercise we will fit simulated XMM RGS data of an X-ray binary with a warm gas along the line of sight. The data can be found in this folder.
The goal of the exercise is to retrieve the temperature of this warm gas and retrieve column densities of the dust and cold gas along this line of sight.

For more inspiration about multi-temperature gas along X-ray binary sightlines check Costantini et al. 2012 or Rogantini et al. 2021.

The filenames are multitemp/simxmm3.res and multitemp/simxmm3.spo

Use the following settings to start:

s.dist(1,7.6,'kpc')
s.com('bb)
s.com('comt')
s.com('hot')
s.com('amol')
s.com('hot')
s.com('hot')
Relate the models!:

s.par(1,1,'t',0.14)
s.par(1,1,'norm',5e-5)
s.par(1,2,'norm',2.0)
s.par(1,2,'t0',0.32)
s.par(1,2,'t1',29)
s.par(1,2,'tau',3)
These are useful dust models for amol:

s.par(1,4,'i1',3302)
s.par(1,4,'i2',4103)
