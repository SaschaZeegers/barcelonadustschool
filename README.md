# Life Cycle of Dust Barcelona 2023
This page containts exercises that will be used at the X-ray interstellar medium hands-on session of the 6th Institute of Space Sciences Summer School: Life Cycle of Dust.
High resolution X-ray spectroscopy provides important and unique information about the interstellar medium, such as abundances of elements, depletion of elements from the gas phase into dust, dust properties (e.g. crystallinity, size and composition) and gas temperatures.

The exercises consist of two parts: 
1) General spex exercises to learn how to work with SPEX
2) Exercises focussed on analysing the interstellar medium

These exercises are licenced through Zenodo and are a subset of the exercises available at the AHEAD 2023 school:
